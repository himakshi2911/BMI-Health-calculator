# Problem Statement


In today’s fast-paced lifestyle, a large number of people are unaware of their body weight status in relation to their height. Many individuals do not know whether they fall under the categories of underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese. Manually calculating Body Mass Index (BMI) using the formula weight (kg) / [height (m)]² is time-consuming, inconvenient, and often leads to calculation errors due to incorrect unit conversion or decimal mistakes. Moreover, people usually do not remember the standard BMI ranges defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) and are unable to correctly interpret their BMI value.
There is no simple, accurate, and freely available offline tool that can instantly calculate BMI, validate user input, classify the result into the correct health category, and display the standard reference table for better understanding.
Therefore, there is a clear need to develop a user-friendly, reliable, and fully functional BMI Calculator using Python that runs on any computer without internet, performs accurate calculations, handles invalid inputs gracefully, and clearly informs the user about their health status based on WHO guidelines.
This project aims to solve the above problems by providing an easy-to-use console-based BMI Calculator that promotes health awareness and encourages people to maintain a healthy weight.

# Scope of the project 

The BMI (Body Mass Index) Calculator is a lightweight, user-friendly Python-based application designed to calculate and interpret a person’s Body Mass Index based on their height and weight. The project demonstrates the practical application of Python programming concepts such as user input handling, mathematical computations, conditional logic, functions/modules, and clear output formatting. It serves as an educational tool as well as a functional utility for health and fitness awareness. The scope includes basic BMI calculation, classification according to WHO standards, health risk indication, and optional enhancements like data storage or graphical interface (depending on your implementation).


# Target Users

This project is intended for:
Beginners learning Python who want a simple yet complete project to practice core concepts
Fitness enthusiasts and individuals tracking their health metrics at home
Students and educators in health, physical education, or computer science classes
Healthcare assistants or nutritionists needing a quick BMI screening tool
Developers looking for a base to extend into larger health/fitness applications

# High-level features

User Input Collection
Accepts weight (in kg or lbs) and height (in cm, meters, or feet/inches)
Supports multiple unit systems with automatic conversion

Accurate BMI Calculation
Uses the standard formula: BMI = weight(kg) / [height(m)]²
Handles unit conversion seamlessly behind the scenes

WHO-Standard BMI Classification
Categorizes the result into:
• Severely Underweight
• Underweight
• Normal (Healthy)
• Overweight
• Obese Class I, II, and III

Health Risk Insights
Displays associated health risks for each category (e.g., risk of malnutrition, cardiovascular diseases, etc.)

User-Friendly Interface
Clear prompts and formatted output
Input validation
