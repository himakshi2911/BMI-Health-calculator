# Problem Statement


In today’s fast-paced lifestyle, a large number of people are unaware of their body weight status in relation to their height. Many individuals do not know whether they fall under the categories of underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese. Manually calculating Body Mass Index (BMI) using the formula weight (kg) / [height (m)]² is time-consuming, inconvenient, and often leads to calculation errors due to incorrect unit conversion or decimal mistakes. Moreover, people usually do not remember the standard BMI ranges defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) and are unable to correctly interpret their BMI value.
There is no simple, accurate, and freely available offline tool that can instantly calculate BMI, validate user input, classify the result into the correct health category, and display the standard reference table for better understanding.
Therefore, there is a clear need to develop a user-friendly, reliable, and fully functional BMI Calculator using Python that runs on any computer without internet, performs accurate calculations, handles invalid inputs gracefully, and clearly informs the user about their health status based on WHO guidelines.
This project aims to solve the above problems by providing an easy-to-use console-based BMI Calculator that promotes health awareness and encourages people to maintain a healthy weight.
